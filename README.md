# NACTL

NACTL stands for NJU99 ACM Contest Template Library. It is forked and modified from [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl).

## Why not a fork?

I would like to, but the original repo is too big and I failed to clone for many attempts :(
Hence I opened a new repo and upload the files. =| 

## Usage

The NACTL is a personal modification, including translating into Chinese, adding some easy algorithms and so on. To make the pdf file, you can issue ``make nactl`` under UNIX-like systems. Unfortunately Windows is not supported (at least on my PC). See the Makefile for detailed use.

## Credits

Full credit to the KTH competitive programming team, especially for Mr Johan's kind help and recommendation. His work helps me a lot.

## License (from KACTL)

As usual for competitive programming, the licensing situation is a bit unclear.
Many source files are marked with license (we try to go with
[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)), but many also aren't.
Presumably good will is to be assumed from other authors, though, and in many cases permission should not be needed since the code is not distributed.
To help trace things back, sources and authors are noted in source files.

Everything in `fuzz-tests` and `build` is implicitly CC0.
